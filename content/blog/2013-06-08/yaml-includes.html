<p><em>This blog post has been copied from <a href="https://higgshunter.wordpress.com/2013/06/08/yaml-file-includes/">my old particle physics blog</a>.</em></p>
<p>I have written an extension to the PyYAML Loader class that allows you to include/import YAML files from within another YAML file.</p>
<p>I’m currently writing a program that will data from a YAML file and create a CV using a template engine. To aid flexibility, I wanted to allow the user to be able to include separate YAML files (e.g. education.yaml, skills.yaml, etc) within a master YAML file which would then be used to make the CV.</p>
<p>An initial search found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/528281/how-can-i-include-an-yaml-file-inside-another">this</a>, which allows users to include a YAML file from within another. However, it’s quite a limited solution – it assumes you only want to include a single file. For my CV program, I wanted to be able to include multiple files within a single section. This could let you have separate files containing publications according to subject, and then include different groups of publications for different CVs.</p>
<p>My solution now supports all three kinds of YAML node: scalar, sequence and mapping. The class could alternatively derive from <code>yaml.CLoader</code> for improved performance when the C++ LibYAML bindings are available.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import yaml
import os.path

class Loader(yaml.Loader):
    def __init__(self, stream):
        self._root = os.path.split(stream.name)[0]
        super(Loader, self).__init__(stream)
        Loader.add_constructor(&#39;!include&#39;, Loader.include)
        Loader.add_constructor(&#39;!import&#39;,  Loader.include)

    def include(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, yaml.ScalarNode):
            return self.extractFile(self.construct_scalar(node))

        elif isinstance(node, yaml.SequenceNode):
            result = []
            for filename in self.construct_sequence(node):
                result += self.extractFile(filename)
            return result

        elif isinstance(node, yaml.MappingNode):
            result = {}
            for k,v in self.construct_mapping(node).iteritems():
                result[k] = self.extractFile(v)
            return result

        else:
            print &quot;Error:: unrecognised node type in !include statement&quot;
            raise yaml.constructor.ConstructorError

    def extractFile(self, filename):
        filepath = os.path.join(self._root, filename)
        with open(filepath, &#39;r&#39;) as f:
            return yaml.load(f, Loader)</code></pre>
<p>Please note that the arguments to <code>!include</code> and <code>!import</code> must be on the same line (due to PyYAML parser).
This allows you to specify YAML files like:</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code>education:    !include education.yaml

activities:   !include [schools.yaml, conferences.yaml, workshops.yaml]

publications: !include {peer_reviewed: publications/peer_reviewed.yaml, internal: publications/internal.yaml}</code></pre>
<p>This Loader class is passed to <code>yaml.load()</code> like so:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>from yaml import load

with open(&#39;document.yaml&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) as f:
    data = load(f, Loader=Loader)</code></pre>
